<i>NOTE: I am not a rail professional nor do I have ties to railroad wheel 
manufacturing, but have applied the neccessary 
physics to the railroad wheel to explain what is happening to the layman.</i>
<hr>
<p>
When a train goes around a curve, the outside wheels have further to 
travel than the inside wheels. This is the same event that occurs in 
automobiles which requires a differential rather than a solid axle. In 
the case of railroads a solid axle is necessary for stregnth and 
simplicity, so another solution was applied.
<p>
The treads of a railroad wheel are not flat, but beveled into a 
hyperbole with the smaller diameter toward the outside and the curve 
leading into the flange. The distance between the inside faces of 
the railheads is slightly larger than the distance between the outside 
faces of the wheel flanges by about an inch. So as one wheel rides 
up its rail, the 
other wheel rides down its rail. The different diameters in contact 
with the rail have different circumfrances, which compensates 
for the different distances of travel.
<p>
<div align="center"><img alt="Diagram" src="/Bin/Diag/rw_cross.gif"><br>
Rail and Wheel Cross-Section</div>
<p>
First let's discuss what keeps the car on the tracks. 
The force pulling the car into the curve is the Centripital Force, 
the generic name for the net force which pulls and object in an arc. 
The components of the Centripital foce are 1) the preceeding 
and following cars through the couplers 2) the 
frictional force between the wheel treads and the railhead 3) Gravitational 
force IF the track is superelevated (banked).
This force tends to coutneract Inertia, but since it is applied to 
the lower quarter of the car, the result is a torqe on the car 
around the center of gravity (COG), tending to rotate it towards rolling out 
of the curve. More important to use here, it also effects the the centering 
action by pushing the trucks toward the inside of the curve relative to the 
car's center of gravity .
<p>
<div align="center"><img alt="Diagram" src="/Bin/Diag/car1.gif"><br>
Forces on a Railcar - End View</div>
<p>
Now Intertia and the Centripital Force counteract to prevent the car from 
flying off the inside or outside of the track, but what keeps the 
flanges from hitting the rail? Now consider the trucks as a separate 
system from the rest of the car. A state of equilibrium 
exists at a point where the circumfrance of each wheel, where it contacts 
the rail, matches the distance it needs to travel in one revolution.
<p>
<div align="center"><img alt="Diagram" src="/Bin/Diag/truck0.gif"><br>
Truck in Equilibrium - Top View</div>
<p>
Prior to reaching equilibrium the outer wheel is climbing the outer rail, 
and we will call this state Undercompensation. Until it reaches that point, 
there is a drag force (against the direction of travel) on the outer wheel 
as where it is being forced by the inner wheel to rotate too slowly  to 
cover the distance it must travel. Similarly the outer wheel is forcing 
the inner wheel to rotate too fast causing a tractional force (in the 
direction of travel). These forces excert a torque on the truck around 
a vertical axis at its connection to the car. This torque pushes the 
the lead outer wheel higher on the rail (giving it a larger diamater) 
and the lead inner wheel lower (giving it a smaller diameter). 
The trailing wheels tend to follow the path of the lead wheels 
forcing the system toward the equilibrium point. 
<p>
<div align="center"><img alt="Diagram" src="/Bin/Diag/truck1.gif"><br>
Truck in Undercompensation - Top View</div>
<p>
Now these forces, and hence the torque, are zero at the equilibrium point, 
but the forces prior to equilibrium may be great enough to cause and 
overshoot, and we will call this state Overcompensation. 
When this happens or when the car is leaving the curve, the diamater of 
the inner wheel is now too small and is dragging and that of the outer 
is too large causing a tractive force. The forces are now reversed and 
exert a torque in the reverse direction that causes the lead 
outer wheel lower on the rail (giving it a smaller diameter) and the lead 
inner wheel up on the rail (giving it a larger diameter). 
This again forces the system back toward the equilibrium point.
<p>
<div align="center"><img alt="Diagram" src="/Bin/Diag/truck2.gif"><br>
Truck in Overcompensation - Top View</div>
<p>
The slightest Overcompensation would cause a oscillation between these two states 
if there was not lateral friciton beween the rail and the wheel. So in this 
way the trucks find their way to the equilibrium point. The exact location 
of the equilibrium point depends on the forces acting on the system, 
especially gravity, the Centripical force, and the geometry of the track. 
<p>
This centering action does not always work well enough. If you observe 
a heavily loaded or fast moving train on a curve, you will 
hear a periodic sqeek or lonq squeal. This results from the 
Overcompensation to the extent that the wheel flange bumps the 
rail head (squeek) or slides along it for a time (squeal), until the 
centering action takes it back towards equilibrium. This can also be 
exagerated by bad track (crowned sectional rail for example) which 
forces the wheels back and forth. 
<p>
The squeal results from the fact the flange strikes the rail just 
before the bottom of travel while it is still moving downward. Also, as 
the wheel climbs into the steepest segment of the hyperbole, gravity 
takes over to foce the wleel back down the flange. So we have friction 
versus gravity resulting in metal scraping on metal. 
This is undesired, but normal, and flange 
greasers are often installed preceeding tight curves on mainlines to cut 
down on damage resulting from this.
<p>
<div align="center"><img alt="Diagram" src="/Bin/Diag/wheel2.gif"><br>
Flange Direction - Side View</div>
<p>
A worse scenario is wheel creep. Once the flange hits the rail 
the centering action only serves to force the flange into the rail. 
If the wheels cannot reach the correct diameter to match their distance of 
travel and periodically either the inner wheel slips backward or the outer 
wheel slips forward. The former is more likely since the inner wheel has 
less contact area with the rail and hence less friction.
This causes the POP-POP sound created on very tight curves.
<p>
A differnt solution than traditional centering action is self steering 
trucks as applied on some new locomotives. in this system the axles 
independently rotate slightly in the truck frame to individually remain 
tangent to the rail. In this way the centering action does not occur as 
suddenly, reducing the Overcompensation that causes flange and rail wear.
<p>
The seemingly obvious solution is to split the axle in the middle, and 
put bearings there. The problem with this is that without the centering 
action that forces the truck around the curve, the truck would always 
plow straight ahead until the flanges hit the rail.

<h4>Wheel and Rail Wear</h4>

All this theory is intended to prolong the life of both the wheel and rail. 
Rail and wheels are produced is a particular shape to create the desired 
effects, but as with all moving parts wear is unavoidable. On the rail, it 
will wear the rail down to a matching hyperbolic shape to the wheel, and the 
wheels will wear into the sharper shape of the rail. Wheels are machined 
as one might expect when the car is serviced. The rail, however, cannot 
be pulled into the shop. Rail grinders, machines which apply properly shaped 
grinding wheels to the rail, can reshape the rail head for a certain number 
of times.
<p>
In extreme cases the inside head of the rail can sink as much as an inch in 
relation to the outside, and eventually the inside part of the rail, or even 
the entire head, will crack and break off. Extremely worn rail will apper as 
it was melted by extreme heat on its inner side.
<p>
The other major defect in wheels is a result of stoppling. In emergency 
situations, and engineer can release all the air from the trains braking 
system, causing the air reserviors on each car to apply the brakes fully. 
This can cause the weels to lock up and skid, grinding part of the weel 
flat. A flat wheel will cause a CLANK-CLANK sound as it passes. It causes 
extreme stress in both the rail and the car as it punds the track. In 
extreme cases, the inbalance and forces can acually cause the weel to jump 
off the rail each revolution, exagerating the problem. The forces applied 
by flat wheels is a major cause of broken rails. Skidding can also be 
caused by and overheated bearing which seizes.
