	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lately at Metrix you might have noticed some electric motor kits for sale on the counter. You may have thought they were done by a large company because they look so professional, but they’re actually cut at the shop, and put together by one of the patrons! David Cole is turning his penchant for design and tinkering into a new business for helping people learn and get creative. As someone who is trying to sell things that I make Metrix, I was happy to get the chance to talk to him about this really neat project and what it means for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC4086.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5244978654/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5244/5244978654_933488ffb5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC4086.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David told me that he’s been a creative person since he was young. And while he’s always loved electronics, he never really knew how they worked. He mentioned to me that, “Electromagnets and motors run our world, but people hardly think of them”. This is definitely true for me. I use my computer everyday, and yet I have only a slight understanding of how the software works, let alone the hardware! It’s easy to get lost in the big picture of our modern machinery. He had been reading about the history of technology and decided that he wanted to understand all the details. And so he made a motor. He learned a bunch, but it also took a lot of energy. He wanted to be able to share what he had learned with others, but make it easy for them to fabricate themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thus, the kits! The best way for me to learn is to do it myself rather than have it be taught to me, and I think that’s true for many other people. I’ve seen some other cool kits lately, such as an embroidery kit and an electronic jewelry kit, and I’m glad to see this motor kit added to the selection, to give people some hands on experience. David said that he’d like to start selling them to schools. I remember when I was in middle school making a battery from lead. Clearly it’s stuck with me, and I think any kind of motor kit like this would be an amazing learning tool for young people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.imaginationhardware.com/images/kit-pic.jpg&quot; height=&quot;671&quot; width=&quot;490&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting part of his kits is the design. He kind of has an advantage over some other makers in that he’s a graphic designer by day. He has experience in branding, website design, and package design, among other things. If you’re going to be seriously selling a product, then this is definitely something you want to learn (or pay someone to do!). Seeing his well put together product and website really makes it clear how much potential all the projects at Metrix have. With the right finish, so many of the interesting an unique items at the shop could be selling well. I was really inspired about what my own creations could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was I inspired by the product, but also by his passion, enthusiasm and ability to make it all happen! David said to me, “I have been following whatever inspires me for years, sticking with my own vision and making sure to follow through on my ideas. I often don’t know where a project might lead, but I pursue it anyway. In the very least it usually results in some kind of learning, and often a connection with an interesting person. I love the quote ‘Inspiration without action is worthless’ - I don’t know who said that, but I live by it.” What a great attitude to have- and it fits so well with what Metrix is trying to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC4080.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5244843860/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5043/5244843860_6a293732f2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC4080.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t forget that the Metrix Craft and Project Extravaganza is happening Thursday from 7-10! You might be able to buy a motor directly from David. I’ll be there, and I hope to see you!&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/mwilson.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;Still unpacking and setting up the new house.  The dining room table showed up on Thursday but there was a complete comedy of errors including the taller legs not fitting, a leaf getting dropped and splitting and one of the accessories being wrong.  It's all getting sorted out, but for the moment we only kind of have a table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday was the company holiday party, &lt;span class=&quot;ljuser ljuser-name_gordonmessmer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gordonmessmer.livejournal.com/profile&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif?v=1&quot; alt=&quot;[info]&quot; width=&quot;17&quot; height=&quot;17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gordonmessmer.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;gordonmessmer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; graciously accompanied me and we had a pretty good time.  I was only mildly hung over on Saturday so Gordon and I went to the International Motorcycle Show and wandered around.  There was a totally sweet sidecar rig owned by Rich of Rich's custom upholstery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/unrepentantgeek/Motorcycles#5550047385177561874&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_bhao8t9ve5A/TQW6sQAYGxI/AAAAAAAAFhM/mCufFALp7to/s480/IMG_20101211_135852.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a kind of dolly that you can park your bike on the center stand and move it around more easily.  Gordon broke down and signed up for the sidecar class, and I put my name down too.  I'll need the refresher because Sunday I scored this lovely little accessory for my bike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/unrepentantgeek/Velorex560#5550020375732219186&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_bhao8t9ve5A/TQWiIF-y7TI/AAAAAAAAFg0/Jmys0RnG1XQ/s480/Picture%204.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's in amazingly good shape for it's age.  It's missing the seat lock (I have one) and a reflector.  Everything else appears to be there and in good shape.  I just need to pick up the attachment bits to bolt it up to the R50.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a couple of years since I was in college, but of course I remember it. Having classes so early in the morning (who expects college students to be at school by 9?), boring teachers and too much homework. Of course, looking back on it, I realize I’m one of the few lucky ones in the world who gets to attend higher education, and I should have appreciated it more while it was happening. Fortunately there are people out there making the most of it. I met John Deppe at Metrix, and he is having a lot of fun going out of his way to make interesting things for school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC4103.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5249974065/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5249974065_9ba91639eb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC4103.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John is working on his associates degree in Everett, and as part of that is taking a drafting class. He told me that all drafting used to be done by hand (on paper!). Of course, in this digital age, everyone now uses computers and really expensive software. His class has been using a program called SolidWorks, which is used for 3D CAD design. For the class final, his teacher gave the students a rather open ended assignment- impress the teacher. Many of his fellow students were creating 3D models with moving parts on the computer, but John decided to take it to the next level and actually make a physical 3D model on one of the printers at Metrix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are unaware, Metrix has several 3D printers called MakerBots. They take tubes of certain kinds of plastic, melt it, and then eject it onto a platform that can move in all three directions, allowing people to make plastic figures up to 4”x4”x6”. Pretty neat-o. Since John was already using a 3D creation program, this was the perfect fit to put what he was learning into practice. The first design he created was too complicated. It looked great on the computer, but ended up not being compatible with the somewhat simple abilities of the MakerBots. After a redesign, he’s figured out how to make is own miniature plastic office chair. He’ll be printing it out in several parts and then joining them together. Without having Metrix to work in, he never would have gotten the valuable experience of having something mess up when it should have worked just fine (a lesson I have learned many times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3697.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5130553473/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1428/5130553473_cafde7825e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3697.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also has a couple of other cool ideas he’s working on at Metrix. He’s mostly done with creating a personalized sticker for his laptop, and will also continue to use Metrix as a tool for helping with his schoolwork. Next quarter he is taking an electrical circuits course (something Metrix knows a lot about), and will also have to do an outreach project with a high school (he’s thinking of doing a project like creating LED flashlights). And he’s only been going to Metrix for a couple of weeks now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had this kind of resource when I was in school. What a great way to take initiative in learning! I went to a small school that didn’t have a lot of the same resources that bigger universities have. I would have probably used the MakerBots or laser cutter for the occasional art class I took, or the plotter for printing a giant poster of all the grammar rules in my language classes. Perfect for staring up at while I was an insomniac. Perhaps someone will figure out how to make a ramen making robot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3434.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5048363896/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5048363896_88ab03a4f3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3434.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metrix has been a great resource for me to have fun, and I’m glad to see that John is able to use it for something more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: libvirtError: monitor socket did not show up</title>

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes errors don&amp;#8217;t float to the top of stacks well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our virtualization stack is pretty automated wherein we have a custom script that uses vmbuilder to create the guest, register it with libvirt, create first boot scripts that will have it register with a chef server, and start the VM. We saw this error today &lt;code&gt;libvirtError: monitor socket did not show up.: Connection refused&lt;/code&gt;, and I commented that my memory contained a lot of libvirt/kvm errors, and many resolutions, but the two don&amp;#8217;t always stay connected. I checked the libvirt logs in /var/log/libvirt and even ran libvirt with &lt;code&gt;LIBVIRT_DEBUG=1 libvirtd -v&lt;/code&gt;. When I tried running kvm by hand using the syntax in the logs, but with the -net options removed from the command line, kvm just spouted &lt;code&gt;Aborted&lt;/code&gt;. After starting at it for a bit, I noticed that instead of &lt;code&gt;-m 1024&lt;/code&gt; KVM was trying to run with &lt;code&gt;-m 1073741824&lt;/code&gt; (1024^3). This was due to a small conversion bug in our custom script.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a Science Fiction show and wanted a future device to be real today? Personally, I’m waiting on teleporters, but one Metrix patron decided to start somewhere a bit more possible- the tricorder. For those not familiar, the tricorder is a piece of technology found in the Star Trek universe. It examines geological, meteorological and biological data (hence, the “tri”). Probably more useful for taking readings of a newly discovered planet, but Ben Bloss is working on making it applicable for everyday Earth use. Being a fan of Star Trek, and having fond childhood memories of watching new episodes of Voyager as they aired with my sister, I was excited to learn about what his plans were for his instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC4062.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5222480537/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5222480537_717f18e8f2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC4062.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course with something like this, it can be hard to know where to start. Ben said that he’s been thinking about several uses for his tricorder, but wanted to prove the technology first with a head-up GPS display. A head-up display is a transparent display that allows you to look through it, while also looking at information presented to you on the display. His will use a piece of transparent acrylic placed in front of one eye with a repurposed rear-view head mounted mirror. On the opposite side of the head would be a small LED display reflected onto the acrylic. At first he tried placing the LED display directly in front of his eye, but he was having a hard time focusing, so he came up with this solution. When put together, it will show GPS data about your current location, course over ground and speed over ground. Once he has this proof finished (which he thinks will take a week and a half), he’s planning on working on other components. He’s already made a cell phone module which can can send information like the temperature to a phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC4058.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5222976732/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5287/5222976732_d9d193cda9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC4058.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Ben’s tricorder idea is interesting because it seems to be a perfect fit with his background. He was working as the navigation officer on an exploration ship for NOAA, which he thinks is maybe the closest thing to actually being on a Starfleet ship. I’m going to have to agree (except that maybe astronauts are closer). What better way to complete the experience than this project? He actually first thought of this when he was on the ship (he spent two years on it, so there was lots of time for thinking I’m guessing), and heard of Metrix for the first time while on the ship as well. He said there were several months of longing to come in and make something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was happy that Metrix allows people to put together projects so quickly, and said that it acts as a catalyst for the creative process. It seems that he has a lot of creativity in him, as he’s just come from finishing a really neat box to hold all his equipment in. I’m definitely glad to see him around the store making neat things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC4065.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5222483673/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5126/5222483673_ee342a6e2b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC4065.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sorts of future technology would you like to see happen? How about the Star Trek communicators? A babel fish-like headpiece? Come and make them happen and impress all your nerd friends! I’m excited for the future and the nifty things that I haven’t even thought about yet. Maybe you can help the future come faster with your maker ingenuity!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a project that exists both in Amazon Web Services EC2 US-EAST-1b and another cloud, I wanted to block network traffic between the two to ensure they didn&amp;#8217;t affect each other. I started by doing an whois looking via ARIN for all of the IP addresses we are currently assigned in EC2, and I ultimately got the same list that I found registered to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://whois.arin.net/rest/org/AMAZO-4/nets&quot;&gt;AMAZO-4&lt;/a&gt; contact with ARIN, with the exception of AMAZON-AES, which I presume is for Amazon Enterprise Solutions. I couldn&amp;#8217;t tell you offhand if the same IP blocks are used in other AWS zones.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Bryan McLellan: Script hacks: waiting for the internet</title>

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now and then the VMs (kvm, libvirt + vmbuilder) I was cranking out would start up too fast, and the &amp;#8220;first boot&amp;#8221; script would run before the host got an IP address and had internet access. Since the first thing I was doing was downloading the Rubygems source using wget (to install chef), and since wget lacks a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=202956#c6&quot;&gt;retry for dns failure&lt;/a&gt;, I hacked up this script to wait for the internet a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain;&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash

# Wait for internet to come up (DHCP)
MAXWAIT=60
WAITTIME=0
host production.cf.rubygems.org &amp;gt; /dev/null

while [ $? == 1 ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; [ $WAITTIME -le $MAXWAIT ] ; do
  WAITTIME=$(($WAITTIME + 10))
  sleep 10
  echo -n .
  host production.cf.rubygems.org &amp;gt; /dev/null
done

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: Holiday and seasonal art and gifts!  ‘Tis the...</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1984954194</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1984954194</link>
	<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lcozbsTUdY1qa5a6qo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holiday and seasonal art and gifts!  ‘Tis the season! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited about the snowflakes above that Gina cut out here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the gifts that so many of you have been cutting out on the laser engraver recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just started working on some edge-lit ornaments…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Edge-lit Ornament Prototype&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5122/5220585646_cacf5551ae_m.jpg&quot; height=&quot;161&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s still time- and if you still need a little help making those designs, come to the Inkscape for Laser Cutting workshop on Sunday, Dec 12 2-4:30pm.  The last half hour is free design time where you can get your project going with Allison still there to help out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: DNS-SD, a printer, and a little luck</title>
	<guid>http://blog.loftninjas.org/?p=565</guid>
	<link>http://blog.loftninjas.org/2010/11/29/dns-sd-a-printer-and-a-little-luck/</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd.txt&quot;&gt;DNS SD&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Apple&amp;#8217;s Bonjour, utilizes DNS as a configuration database for automatic service discovery. For the most part, it appears its used by devices more than people. The multicast implementation, or mDNS, is what makes printers automatically show up in OS X when you put them on your network. I recently moved such a printer from a flat network, to one where the wired and wireless workstations were on separate subnets. In an attempt to make the printer easy to find, I implemented DNS SD over unicast so OS X laptops in the office could detect the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/bonjourprinting.pdf&quot;&gt;printer with Bonjour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I set the Domain Name to &amp;#8220;office.opscode.com&amp;#8221; using DHCP, so I would have a nice sandbox to mess around with DNS without breaking anything. Then I created a few DNS records:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; wrap-lines: false;&quot;&gt;
OfficejetPro8500.office.opscode.com A 172.28.0.5
lb._dns-sd._udp.office.opscode.com PTR office.opscode.com.
b._dns-sd._udp.office.opscode.com PTR office.opscode.com.
_printer._tcp.office.opscode.com PTR _OfficejetPro8500._pdl-datastream._tcp.office.opscode.com.
_pdl-datastream._tcp.office.opscode.com PTR _OfficejetPro8500._pdl-datastream._tcp.office.opscode.com.
_OfficejetPro8500._pdl-datastream._tcp.office.opscode.com SRV 0 0 9100 OfficejetPro8500.office.opscode.com.
_OfficejetPro8500._pdl-datastream._tcp.office.opscode.com TXT &amp;quot;txtvers=1&amp;quot; &amp;quot;note=Office Entry&amp;quot; &amp;quot;usb_MFG=HP&amp;quot; &amp;quot;usb_MDL=Officejet Pro 8500 A909g&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ty=HP Officejet Pro 8500&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifies the internal IP address of the resource. We use this later in the SRV record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What domain the client should browse if they haven&amp;#8217;t specified one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What domain a client in this domain should browse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a LPR/LPD printer. LPR is the &amp;#8220;Flagship&amp;#8221; protocol and &amp;#8220;must&amp;#8221; be defined (Port 515)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a PDL printer, sometimes called raw (Port 9100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the printer service. The last four fields there are priority, weight, port and host, per &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2782.txt&quot;&gt;RFC 2782&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide additional configuration information related to the printer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a lot of clear information regarding how you should specify multiple key/value pairs in the TXT field. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt&quot;&gt;RFC 1035&lt;/a&gt; specifies, &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;character-string&amp;gt; is a single length octet followed by that number of characters.  &amp;lt;character-string&amp;gt; is treated as binary information, and can be up to 256 characters in length (including the length octet)&lt;/em&gt;. For Microsoft DNS, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grouplogic.com/Knowledge/PDFUpload/Info/WanBonjour_1.pdf&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. I was using DynInc&amp;#8217;s Dynect, and was able to put all the key/value pairs in double quotes in the single input field. Also, if you are too, use the &amp;#8220;Expert Editor&amp;#8221; which is a menu option under the &amp;#8220;Simple Editor,&amp;#8221; it is a little easier to specify the multi-part hostnames this way. It &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.apple.com/archives/macos-x-server/2007/Mar/msg00781.html&quot;&gt;sounds like in bind&lt;/a&gt; you put one key/value pair in double quotes per line, with the series wrapped in parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynect wouldn&amp;#8217;t let me specify the SRV record without a preceding underscore, which is a shame, because this is what OS X detects as the device name which also lower-cased it, making it a little difficult to read. You should be able to spaces in these names, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t about to try escaping that. The key/value pairs in the TXT resource record are documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/bonjourprinting.pdf&quot;&gt;Apple Bonjour Printing specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;txtvers / Define what version of this format we are using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;note / User-readable information about the device, OS X displays this as Location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usb_MFG / the Manufacturer name that the USB driver would specify. I made educated guesses at these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usb_MDL / the Model that the USB device would specify. Combined with the last field this will choose the driver for the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ty / a User-readable name for the device. I had hoped this would be used in the Printer Name field in the GUI, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

	<title>Andrew Filer: Extending a keyboard with LASERS</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5216395218/&quot; title=&quot;Lasered keyboard&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5216395218_aaa15418c5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5215803729/&quot; title=&quot;Lasered keyboard&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5009/5215803729_12ede1cbec.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Photo by Duncan at &lt;a href=&quot;http://metrixcreatespace.com/&quot;&gt;Metrix&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/people/metrixcreate/&quot;&gt;flickr stream&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since Unicode &amp;#8220;works&amp;#8221; in most places on the internet these days (from webpages to Twitter to IRC in terminal sessions), I like to use all the characters that are available to me, when they make sense &amp;#8212; like &amp;#8220;99¢&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;-40°&amp;#8221;. I decided go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://metrixcreatespace.com/&quot;&gt;Metrix&lt;/a&gt; and laser many of the characters accessible from Alt(Gr) into the keycaps on my MacBook Pro. The keyboard is backlit and lasering the key exposes the clear key underneath, so it turned out quite well. If I&amp;#8217;m feeling like there still isn&amp;#8217;t enough visual interference on my keyboard, I may decide to laser on the AltGr and Cyrillic characters too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: My feelings on Metrix</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1688511608</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1688511608</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been coming to Metrix since its inception. I’ve known Matt, the owner, for a couple of years through my relationships with others in the maker community. Seeing Metrix from its incomplete state, through it’s opening, and now to its expansion has been great. The store’s atmosphere hasn’t changed much from how it was when it opened- it’s still open to the public, still a great place to come and feel inspired by creative energy, and of course a place to meet new like-minded friends. Since I’ve been coming here for over a year now, I’ve been able to make a lot of really neat things, and I’m excited to make more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3865.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5173760749/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5173760749_ebe761f341.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3865.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Metrix opened, there were some other maker spaces that I went to in Seattle. And while they were fun and had a lot of really interesting things happening in them, I never felt like I really belonged. There were certain kinds of projects that these spaces liked working on and they were never what I was interested in. There seemed to be a lot of clique-like mentalities to the people who hung out there too, which was off-putting. And then there was Metrix. I walked in and didn’t feel like I had anything to prove. I didn’t have to be working on certain kinds of projects to be considered cool. I didn’t even have to be working on a project! I could come in and just use their Wi-Fi if I wanted. What a completely refreshing change of atmosphere. That’s probably the thing I like best about this place. Anyone can come and work on whatever they want without being judged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3813.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5165733191/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1180/5165733191_07735cfacb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3813.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s other things I like too, of course. The incredibly vast selection of tools and materials is impressive. The one I like to use the most is the laser cutter. I make and sell jewelry that’s cut on it, and I really like being able to tell people that I watched as the magic happened. There are websites that you can send a design to and have them cut it out, and I think it really takes away from the hand-made feeling. So when people learn that there’s a laser cutter at a local business that I use, they can see that it’s not just about me making a profit- I’m also part of a community. I know I’m not the only one who feels part of it. Metrix is so inclusive of everyone who walks in its doors and has a project in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3988.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5203138865/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5163/5203138865_348ae0cb70.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3988.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing are the workshops. I’ve taken the Intro to Electronics course and really learned a lot and enjoyed it. The time really flew by and wasn’t like a normal classroom experience at all. Personal attention to my learning really helped me. And after my workshops, people always tell me that they learned so much more in two hours than they could have figured out on their own. I’d like to think they aren’t just flattering me. I love teaching my workshop on Inkscape as it’s a program that I’ve loved using for many years. I’m glad I get the opportunity to share my knowledge and help other people in being creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creativity comes in many forms. Many people come in to work on writing code, and not on making physical projects. There’s a large meetup once a week where hacker friends get together, but it also happens on a smaller scale. I think it can be hard to write code from home. There are a lot of distractions, but people don’t generally want to be in the office, especially if they’re working on something personal. Metrix allows those people a space to relax and think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3764.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5159631030/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1315/5159631030_38bba79778.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3764.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just some of my thoughts on Metrix. I’m sure I’ll continue to enjoy coming here. I hope you do too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: The Metrix snOMG 2010 Challenge</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;condutive thread&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5202654748_b16c3c6b87_m.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;161&quot; /&gt;We have conductive thread. Conductive thread is usually used in costuming when one wants to integrate electronics like blinking LEDs into one’s fancy dress. Conductive thread is also great for modding gloves to be smart phone friendly - a couple of stitches and you can click and type to your heart’s delight without taking your gloves off. Conductive thread is handy stuff to have when it’s cold out, and right now, we have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do not have are snowmen. We are greatly desirous of some little snowmens - with all the traffic on N Broadway, there isn’t a lot of good snow left to make them with.  And even if there was, we are very busy in our workshop, what with all the lasering and crafting and making that we have to do in preparation for the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the festive spirit of snOMG 2010, Metrix is conducting a small contest. A challenge, if you will. We have conductive thread, and you may have a little snowman. The first five people to bring us a snowperson* with which to decorate our sidewalk will get their gloves modded with conductive thread for free. You will get conductive thread and we will even sew it into the fingers of your gloves for you, in exchange for a snowbuddy made from actual snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*This term is inclusive of snowwomen, snow-intersexed, and snow-genderqueer individuals, as well as snowmen. Only snowpeople made from actual snow will be accepted for this challenge. Hurry up and bring us some before the snow melts!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: Changes to Laser Prices</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1607467830</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1607467830</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve made some changes to pricing for our laser cutter, as well as our “no-cut list”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, we’re now charging an extra 50¢ per minute for cutting acrylic (even the acrylic we stock) and other substances that smell up the shop too much.  This surcharge is applied &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; any discounts, so large acrylic jobs that used to be $1/minute are now $1.50/minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the chemistry.  Due to safety concerns, we’ve never cut materials containing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen&quot;&gt;halogens&lt;/a&gt; (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine, and ununseptium).  These elements, when burned, form a poisonous gas.  Common substances containing halogen elements are PVC plastics, including most vinyls (chlorine), and teflon (fluorine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure whether a substance contains halogens, the most reliable way to tell is to look up its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msds.com/&quot;&gt;materials safety data sheet&lt;/a&gt;.  Failing that, we can perform a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_test&quot;&gt;flame test&lt;/a&gt; on it.  This will detect the presence of halogens, &lt;em&gt;except for fluorine&lt;/em&gt;.  NYC Resistor has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nycresistor.com/2008/08/28/how-to-identify-polymers-with-burnination/&quot;&gt;a good post about flame tests&lt;/a&gt; that you might want to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other plastics are safe to cut, though we’re not willing to cut the smellier ones, such as styrenes (ABS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have an absolute ban on stingray leather (aka stinkray).  Regular cow leather is okay, though it’s a bit noxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t want to stink up the shop or poison ourselves (and you!), not because we like making up rules, but because we like to make Metrix Create:Space a good place to hang out and make things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: virt-manager keymaps on OS X</title>
	<guid>http://blog.loftninjas.org/?p=556</guid>
	<link>http://blog.loftninjas.org/2010/11/17/virt-manager-keymaps-on-os-x/</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not crazy about the lack of a definitive package manager for OS X. I tried for about a day to work with Open Source on OS X, then I built an Ubuntu VM. I&amp;#8217;ve been using ssh with X forwarding when I need a graphical interface; OS X has reasonable good built in support for X11. However, others have found that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arnebrodowski.de/blog/keymap-problems-with-virt-manager.html&quot;&gt;keymap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shortbus.org/bloggin/2009/06/01/apples-x11-keymap-and-virt-manager/&quot;&gt;meta keys&lt;/a&gt; are broken. While I got a kick out of &amp;#8220;After some time I discovered that the number 8 is interpreted as Return,&amp;#8221; I did need to log in to a guest to do some debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://shortbus.org/bloggin/2009/06/01/apples-x11-keymap-and-virt-manager/&quot;&gt;accepted solution&lt;/a&gt; to making Ctrl+Alt release keyboard focus correctly in the vncviewer spawned by virt-manager is to create a .Xmodmap file in your home directory with this content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; gutter: false;&quot;&gt;
clear Mod1
keycode 66 = Alt_L
keycode 69 = Alt_R
add Mod1 = Alt_L
add Mod1 = Alt_R
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I killed the X server by focusing on it and choosing quit, and it seemed to be read the .Xmodmap file okay without my needing to restart the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arnebrodowski.de/blog/keymap-problems-with-virt-manager.html&quot;&gt;broken keymap&lt;/a&gt; pointed me in the right direction, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t happy with the solution. A little digging around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html&quot;&gt;libvirt domain xml&lt;/a&gt; reference pointed out that you can add a keymap as an attribute to the vnc element in the domain xml definition. Use &amp;#8216;virsh edit&amp;#8217; to edit the domain XML and modify the vnc line to add this attribute so it looks like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; gutter: false;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;graphics type='vnc' port='5900' autoport='yes' listen='127.0.0.1' keymap='en-us'/&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I destroyed the guest and restarted it and the keyboard worked now without any &amp;#8220;8 is now enter&amp;#8221; trickery. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mail-archive.com/libvir-list@redhat.com/msg13340.html&quot;&gt;choose any keymap&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/qemu/keymaps&lt;/code&gt;. If you use vmbuilder you will want to add this to &lt;code&gt;/etc/vmbuilder/libvirt/libvirtxml.tmpl&lt;/code&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: Yay for brains!</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1605281844</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1605281844</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve seen some popular videos online showing these really neat toys called quadrocopters. They’re basically just small flying toys with four rotors on each corner of the shell. They can hover and maneuver quite easily and are pretty interesting to watch. The other day I was in Metrix, and to my surprise I saw a couple of people working with one of them! I wanted to see what they were up to, and found out that this particular model of copter could be controlled directly from an iPhone! It also had a camera attached to the front allowing the phone user to see exactly what the copter sees. How cool! Of course, it wouldn’t be Metrix if someone wasn’t tweaking it to do something awesome. These two guys were attempting to get the copter working directly with the power of… your brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3915.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5176065415/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5176065415_0ebca46a65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3915.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How were they going to accomplish that? Well one of the guys, Andrew Becherer brought the copter, and the other, Adam Smith-Kipnis brought a brain wave measuring device. I’ve seen these used in conjunction with toys before, but this one seemed a bit more sophisticated. It’s basically a headset with headphones and a sensor that rests against the forehead. This sensor can detect brainwaves (raw EEG values) and outputs it as numerical values. This digital data can then be used to play some games that come with the device, but it also allows its users to be more creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the copter and the headset come with development tools for multiple platforms. This allows them (and anyone else who owns one) to write software to use the devices in new and fun ways. The copter is pretty straightforward to understand and control. Depending on the speed of each fan, the craft can move in a variety of directions. Brain waves, on the other hand, are much more abstract. The two modes that the headset can understand are “attention” and “meditation”. But what does that mean? Adam told me that one of the challenges of this project was figuring out what those words meant to the headset, how to consistently reproduce those feelings, and how to translate a feeling into code that operates another device. They’re currently working on writing the interface (in C++), and hope to then be able to use that to allow the two devices to interact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3914.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5175956821/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5175956821_d012a948fd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3914.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said that one of the reasons it was so hard to understand what the feelings of attention and meditation mean to the headset is that the manufacturer has decided to keep that information proprietary. However, with the stream parser that comes with the headset, they hope to maybe be able to translate other feelings into usable instructions. Could feeling happy allow the copter to move up and down? What about feeling worried? Understanding other feelings is a bit down the road though, so currently they’ve been learning how to train their bodies to feel in a way the headset can already understand. Adam said that meditation got the best response when he was in a half sleep-half awake state, and that attention felt like focusing on something really hard. He said it takes a lot of training to be able to put out the right kind of brain waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew mentioned that the headset is also trained to ignore facial motion, except for blinking. He thought that if they’re able to accurately control their wave functions, that maybe they could also incorporate blinking. One blink could mean one command, two blinks could mean another. That way they could have at least four parameters. He said they were also thinking of maybe bringing in another set of controls, such as with a Wiimote, joystick or iPhone to work in combination with the body. To get a more sophisticated response from the copter, you have to be able to do tilting and spinning at the same time, which would be a lot easier with an external device. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cool part about this story is how these two guys came to be working on their project. When I first saw them sitting there, I thought for sure they had been friends for a while. Turns out, they only met two weeks ago! They got to talking about the neat stuff they wanted to hack together and came upon the idea for this project right then. Even though they are currently only working on software and don’t actually need to use any of Metrix’s tools, they still chose to stop by. Why? They told me that Metrix had good creative energy and was a good place to work. I certainly agree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3903.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5175941137/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5175941137_af325e5cda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3903.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They plan on meeting once a week at Metrix to get their proof of concept finished (controlling altitude with attention), and then hope on getting it fully functioning. Once this is finished, they might move on to controlling a robot Andrew owns with brain waves as well, or even building their own quadrocopter. Their code will be released open source, so perhaps you could make something too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These kinds of projects really make me think about the future. I’ve already seen videos of amputees controlling robotic arms with just their brains, and computers seem to be moving in a direction of more intuitiveness and organic type interaction. Are we on a path to controlling all our devices with our brains? Imagine never having to use a mouse or keyboard again. I also wonder what making art with direct brain output (instead of using hands as a middleman) would look like. If our brains can talk to our devices and our devices can talk to each other, is telepathy in our future? I’m probably stretching a bit, but it’s still pretty cool to see a piece of the future in action today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: Winter's coming...</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1550218847</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1550218847</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, my family and I would always do arts and crafts to prepare for holidays or a change in seasons. One of my favorite times of year was the beginning of winter, just for this reason! I loved making snowflakes and hanging them in the window.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, when I got older things changed. People just don’t appreciate cut out snowflakes when you’re 23 instead of 3. I decided that this year would change that. I made some amazing snowflakes on the laser cutter at Metrix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3809.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5165617141/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1214/5165617141_b0de4ecefe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3809.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first style I made was inspired by the lights that have recently been hung on Broadway, the street that Metrix is on. they’re in the shape of a snowflake, but they’re made up of small, white lights. I really love how soft and warm the lights make the sharp corners of the snowflake look. These lights get put up every year, and I never get tired of looking at them.&lt;br /&gt;I started by creating the basic shape of a star. I then added a line coming from each point, and made it branch off into a couple of more lines. Then I added circles to make the star look like the lights outside. I thought the ultimate effect was pretty neat (if I do say so myself) and didn’t take very long to make. Using basic shapes like stars, circles and triangles will get you a lot of really neat looking snowflakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3787.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5166132662/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4015/5166132662_0849530a15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3787.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted my next snowflake to be themed on something Metrix does well- electronics. I thought that the shapes seen on circuit boards were intricate and beautiful; perfect for hanging in a window. My original idea was to create a six pointed snowflake, with each point containing a circuit inside. I wasn’t sure if the paper could handle being cut up that much though, so I modified my idea. Each circuit board would be cut out on a different piece of paper. They could then be hung from each other going down, or hung on a shared string horizontally. I can definitely see these hung merrily in a window, or even used as wall art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3791.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5166132422/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5166132422_6682a00c08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3791.JPG&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; width=&quot;334&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I wanted to make something a bit more traditional. I found some images online to gain inspiration from. Creative Commons images are a good place to start if you want pictures to directly copy to make your personal snowflakes. The laser is super accurate. It was able to cut my snowflakes out down to the tiniest curve. It looks like something I bought in a store, but I made them myself!&lt;br /&gt;After I was done, I hung my snowflakes on the wall at Metrix to give inspiration to anyone else in a wintery mood. I think I might cut some more the next time I’m in and make a snowflake mobile with various sizes of flakes. Or maybe string up the small holiday lights I have in my house and tape the paper flakes in front of them, causing them to glow. Or, how cool would these be cut in wood? I could have winter coasters for my drinks! There’s all sorts of fun things to do with pretty shapes and a laser cutter.Even the negative space left in the paper after I cut my flakes out is beautiful. I wonder what I could turn that into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3798.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5165615601/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5165615601_e4af44b217.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3798.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper that I used was a construction paper I found at an art store. It was able to keep its shape pretty well, even with so many holes because of its thickness. I’m sure something like card stock would work even better. Thick felt would look good too, and feel soft. Of course Metrix also has wood to cut out on. Snowflakes made of wood would last a long time, and could even be painted, if that was another craft you wanted to try out.&lt;br /&gt;If you’re curious how you can make your own snowflakes, or anything else you can cut on a laser cutter, I’m teaching a workshop this Sunday all about learning to use Inkscape for laser cutting. Information can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1529017018/workshops-for-november-and-december-please-take-a&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Come to the class, and see what kind of memories you can create. Of course, Metrix still has scissors for all you traditionalists out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: 5 cent payphone coming soon.</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1486465135</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/1486465135</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Allison, and I teach the Inkscape workshop at Metrix. Matt, the owner of Metrix, wanted me to write about some of the cool and interesting things I see at Metrix on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past couple of days I’ve noticed Andy Filer, Metrix regular, working at a table covered in various phone parts. I asked him what he was doing, and he told me that he’s helping Metrix add a payphone into a small closet in a corner of the shop. He also told me that every call made from the phone would be five cents, no matter where in the world it was to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3618.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5122000385/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1129/5122000385_a0f44095fd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3618.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this isn’t going to be an average payphone. He’s been working very hard by taking out most of the non-mechanical insides of the phone and replacing them with a custom setup consisting of an Arduino, the insides from a different phone, an analog terminal adaptor, and a hand wired board that helps manage the accepting or rejecting of coins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since all of the insides of the phone were spread about and easy to see, I asked him to explain what exactly was going on when someone makes a call on this thing. What did he have to change to make it work the way he wanted? His answer was long, but I certainly learned a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first put a coin into the phone, it gets sorted by the coin validator (common in payphones and vending machines). The validator has different switches that get flipped as different coins come in.  The Arduino watches the switches and makes a different beep depending on which type of coin (quarter, nickel or dime) gets put into the phone. These beeps then go through the terminal adaptor over the Internet to a FreeSWITCH server which makes sense of the beeps. (Before reaching FreeSWITCH the noises are treated like speech by other parts of the phone.) When you press buttons on the phone, they also make a certain sound that can get interpreted as numbers by FreeSWITCH. Metrix employee Duncan Smith, working with Andy, is working to program the FreeSWITCH server to understand the meanings of different sequences and lengths of frequencies. He will also have to tell it what to do once it receives those beeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3623.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5122605400/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/5122605400_4e8ca793fe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3623.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arduino doesn’t just know what the meanings of beeps are. Andy has programmed it to know whether the phone is on or off the hook, and also if the phone is being “supervised”. If a phone call is supervised, that means that it is charging for time on the line. If one were to call the operator or an emergency line for example, the phone call would not be supervised. Traditionally a call would only begin supervision upon someone picking up on the other end of the line. This information is sent by the phone network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arduino also is connected to the innards taken from a separate phone. The interface between these two was also built by him. These phone parts oversee normal phone operations such as handling the voice through the transmitter and receiver in the handset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interface written by him is from the Arduino to the board (wired by him) that controls the hopper relay. (The hopper is the part of the phone coins go to after being sorted.) This relay moves coins into either the coin box storage area or the coin return, depending on if FreeSWITCH decides to put the call through. There needs to be a separate board because the relay (a mechanical part kept from the original pay phone design) needs about 48 volts to operate. An Arduino only gives out about 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the FreeSWITCH server knows that the amount of money that was put into the phone is correct, and it has a usable phone number it will put the call through. It does this through a VOIP service named, “Call with Us”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, did you get all that? (It certainly took me a couple of tries.) FreeSWITCH is connected to the terminal adaptor, which is connected to the Arduino. The Arduino is connected to the parts taken from another phone, the coin validator, and the accept/reject board. That board is connected to the hopper (which is fed from the validator), and it’s connected to both the coin box and coin return. A somewhat complicated system but very interesting to learn about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3624.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5122605670/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1326/5122605670_53b04f6bc8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3624.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When asked why he wanted to work on this project, he replied, “There was a payphone around and it wasn’t functioning as is, so we wanted to see what made it tick. Then we knew it was possible to do something cool with it, so why not make it a real payphone? It’s funny. Have you seen a nickel payphone in the 21st century? It’s more of a 1940s thing.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely true. Currently the phone can make some calls, though Andy is still making tweaks to the inside. He hopes to have it installed by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems as though payphones are going to become extinct sometime soon. I wonder what would happen if all of the payphones in Seattle were retrofitted to make calls over Skype. Would people, perhaps those who normally couldn’t afford an international phone call, be more likely to use them? There has been a concern that VOIP services can’t make 911 calls, although Andy is addressing this issue by adding the functionality to the Metrix phone. I don’t see what could stop the city from doing that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we do move towards a system where more people own cell phones instead of landlines, I like seeing something like this phone act as a bridge between two worlds. So many people think that everything from the past has to be gotten rid of in order to move forward. Clearly that isn’t the case. I wonder about other kinds of old technologies that we’ve given up on that could maybe be given new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an interest in creating new from old, come over to Metrix and experiment. Maybe you’ll even want to make a phone call or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;_DSC3715.JPG by metrixcreate, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/metrixcreate/5141344949/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1115/5141344949_92b2bba97c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;_DSC3715.JPG&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chargers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AC1) Motorola DC4050US0301 5.1V DC 850MA&lt;br /&gt;
AC2) AT&amp;#038;T 03577 5.0V 1000ma&lt;br /&gt;
DC1) AT&amp;#038;T USB VPC03578&lt;br /&gt;
DC2) AT&amp;#038;T USB + MiniUSB MV302927&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M1) Motorola SKN6378A&lt;br /&gt;
M2) &amp;#8220;Motorola&amp;#8221; SKN6238A&lt;br /&gt;
M3) Monoprice generic microusb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead Phone, AC1, M1 OR M2 OR M3&lt;br /&gt;
Green light on Phone, OS starts, displays charging battery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead Phone, AC2, M1 OR M2 OR M3&lt;br /&gt;
Blue light on AC2, Green light on Phone, OS starts&lt;br /&gt;
Green light / OS cycle every 15 seconds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead Phone, DC1, M1 OR M2 OR M3&lt;br /&gt;
White light on DC1, Green light on Phone, OS starts&lt;br /&gt;
Green light / OS cycle every 15 seconds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead Phone, DC2, M1 OR M2 OR M3&lt;br /&gt;
White light on DC2, Green light alternates on/off on Phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone on, AC1, M1 OR M2 OR M3&lt;br /&gt;
Green light on, charge symbol in battery on display&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone on, AC2, M1&lt;br /&gt;
Blue light on AC2 for five seconds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone on, AC2, M2 OR M3&lt;br /&gt;
Blue light on AC2&lt;br /&gt;
Green light on, no charge symbol in battery on display&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an AT&amp;#038;T AC charger at work that I believe works as well as the stock Motorola. The AT&amp;#038;T AC charger here at home, listed above, is a &amp;#8220;five star&amp;#8221; model that consumes 0W when not charging, I assume that is what the blue light turning off indicates. Hopefully the combinations that keep the green light on the phone on are charging, just very slowly, and are still somewhat useful. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: Munin Aggregation with Multigraph</title>
	<guid>http://blog.loftninjas.org/?p=535</guid>
	<link>http://blog.loftninjas.org/2010/10/22/munin-aggregation-with-multigraph/</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months ago I made note to the pattern for referring to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.loftninjas.org/2010/04/08/an-evening-with-munin-graph-aggregation/&quot;&gt;stacked graph data sources in munin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;load.double.stack one=localhost.localdomain:load.load two=localhost.localdomain:load.load&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This syntax evaluates to:&lt;br /&gt;
graph.value.stack line=host.domain:plugin.value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been using multigraph more since then, which is a boon to performance, but it complicates stacked graphs a little. This hurts because it remains very difficult to tell why your graphs are not drawing when you incorrectly reference a data source. To debug, as the munin user (use &amp;#8217;su -l munin&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8217;sudo -s -u munin&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;chpst -u munin&amp;#8217;) run:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/usr/share/munin/munin-graph --service 'load.double.stack' --debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Be sure to replace &amp;#8220;load.double.stack&amp;#8221; with the name of the graph you&amp;#8217;re trying to draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/aggregate_examples&quot;&gt;munin wiki example for stacked graphs&lt;/a&gt; explains data source names as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain;&quot;&gt;
snmp_ups_current.inputtotal.sum \
---------------- ---------- ---
        |             |      |
        |             |      `-- The sum mechanism
        |             `--------- One of this virtual plugin's values
        `----------------------- The name of the virtual plugin

ups-5a:snmp_ups_ups-5a_current.inputcurrent \
ups-5b:snmp_ups_ups-5b_current.inputcurrent
------ ----------------------- ------------
   |               |                 |
   |               |                 `------ The &amp;quot;inputcurrent&amp;quot; value from the real plugin
   |               `------------------------ The real plugin's name (symlink)
   `---------------------------------------- The host name from which to seek information
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with multigraph the name of the plugins symlink isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily the name of the graph. The trick I found was to connect the the munin node and call the multigraph plugin, looking for the &amp;#8216;multigraph&amp;#8217; line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain;&quot;&gt;
$ nc localhost 4949
# munin node at server.example.org
cap multigraph # tell munin-node that you are multigraph aware
cap multigraph
fetch diskstats # fetch the diskstats multigraph plugin
multigraph diskstats_latency
sdb_avgwait.value 0
multigraph diskstats_latency.sdb
avgwait.value 0
.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve removed a significant portion of the returned data here. Pay attention to the fact that this plugin returned a &amp;#8220;diskstats_latency&amp;#8221; graph that contains data for all of the disks, as well as individual graphs for each disk, here &amp;#8220;diskstats_latency.sdb&amp;#8221; In this example your stacked graph configuration would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain;&quot;&gt;
disk.double.stack \
  one=localhost.localdomain:diskstats_latency.sdb.avgwait \
  two=localhost.localdomain:diskstats_latency.sdb.avgwait
  -1- ----------2---------- -----------3--------- ---4---
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The alias and label for this host or data point&lt;br /&gt;
(2) The configured node name of the host&lt;br /&gt;
(3) The original graphs name, either the plugin or multigraph name&lt;br /&gt;
(4) The value from the plugin/graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that while the period is used to separate the value from the rest of the field, there may be periods in the rest of the field. Also keep in mind that in the past I have seen dashes in configured graph names become underscores at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: Community Cooking</title>
	<guid>http://blog.loftninjas.org/?p=520</guid>
	<link>http://blog.loftninjas.org/2010/10/20/community-cooking/</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a year since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opscode.com/blog/2009/10/29/the-new-opscode-cookbook-site-/&quot;&gt;Opscode Cookbook site was launched&lt;/a&gt; and a recent project got me thinking about what parts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.loftninjas.org/2009/10/30/opscode-cookbooks-community-announced/&quot;&gt;my hopes that I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; then have taken effect so far. I recently heard that a major Chef user has switched to Ubuntu from another Linux distribution because that is what most of the cookbooks that Opscode maintains are written for and tested on. Choice of distribution is typically something that is very dear to administrators and somewhere in the world there is a flame war on this topic every second. Consequently, this is huge and I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about it for a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one thing for a company to choose a distribution based on a software package that is significant to them; in the past I have had to battle against stakeholders that wanted to choose a particular distribution solely on the availability of support. Chef runs on a lot of platforms, but of course some get much more attention than others because that is where the community is. But here we&amp;#8217;re seeing a company choose their distribution not because of Chef&amp;#8217;s support for it, but for the community support for Cookbooks that run on it. This is clear evidence that what I wrote about is starting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working on a Chef + Cobbler writeup in my spare time. I went out the other day and bought a consumer desktop to use as a libvirt/kvm host for this project. It often tends to be least painful to use cloud resources, but sometimes that which is taken care of for you is too unknown, too much of a &amp;#8220;black box,&amp;#8221; and you need the deep visibility into your infrastructure that building it yourself provides. There is indication that some have gotten Cobbler &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-linux-provisioning-automation-with-cobbler.html&quot;&gt;running on&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://terrarum.net/administration/deploying-ubuntu-with-cobbler.html&quot;&gt;deploying Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to have taken hold. There&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CobblerSpec&quot;&gt;launchpad spec&lt;/a&gt; claiming there is a package, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t find it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/server-lucid-cobbler&quot;&gt;Another spec&lt;/a&gt; makes it clear that files for debian packaging from upstream are not finished. It is here that I first ran into problems. I couldn&amp;#8217;t get the init.d scripts provided in the debian/ directory of the upstream repository to work. They clearly needed some help, and after spending some time on them it became clear that they&amp;#8217;re untested templates created by debhelper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal wasn&amp;#8217;t to fix these init scripts, I just wanted to get the cobbler server running. Then I remembered that we had a great existing runit cookbook that I was familiar with. The API for the cookbook site has progressed since release. Unfortunately the &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.opscode.com/faqs/cookbooksite/cookbook-site-rest-api&quot;&gt;documentation for the cookbook API&lt;/a&gt; is a little behind, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.opscode.com/faqs/cookbooksite/downloading-a-cookbook-from-the-opscode-cookbook-site&quot;&gt;new functionality&lt;/a&gt; has been built into knife, the command line tool that interacts with the Chef server or Opscode platform, as well as multiple cloud providers. From within my personal &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Repository&quot;&gt;chef-repo&lt;/a&gt;, I ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;knife cookbook site vendor runit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This downloaded the runit cookbook from the Cookbooks site into a branch in my chef-repo git repository, then merged it into my current branch, allowing me to track changes between my local copy and the upstream copy using git. Then I added a couple templates and a call to the runit_service definition to my cookbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;templates/default/sv-cobbler-run.erb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash;&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
exec 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
exec /usr/bin/env cobblerd -F
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;templates/default/sv-cobbler-log-run.erb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: bash;&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/sh
exec svlogd -tt ./main
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recipes/default.rb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: ruby;&quot;&gt;
# SNIP
runit_service &amp;quot;cobbler&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then cobblerd was running under runit. There&amp;#8217;s beauty in being able to take something somewhat complex like runit, and make it easy. So easy, that I used it rather than fixing up an init script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I found that cobbler wanted to called through apache as proxy. No problem though, I vendored the apache2 cookbook as well. I spent a few minutes determining that I needed a couple of Apache modules, as the Cobbler instructions are pretty centric to Redhat and I got the impression that they make assumptions about what that gives you. Then I used the apache2 cookbook to proxy cobbler by adding this to the top of my recipe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recipes/default.rb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: ruby;&quot;&gt;
include_recipe &amp;quot;apache2&amp;quot;
include_recipe &amp;quot;apache2::mod_proxy_http&amp;quot;
include_recipe &amp;quot;apache2::mod_python&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some permission problems with mod_proxy, again likely a difference between Redhat and Ubuntu, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t out of my way to ship the apache config provided by upstream using Chef with a small modification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;Proxy http://localhost:25151&amp;gt;
    AddDefaultCharset off
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
&amp;lt;/Proxy&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll write about the Cobbler cookbook more later. You can, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookbooks.opscode.com/cookbooks/cobbler&quot;&gt;follow it on the Cookbook site&lt;/a&gt; in the interim. I want to emphasize how I used a single command to grab existing code and leverage it to make it easier for me to do what I was trying to do: get Cobbler running. The Cookbook site combined with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.opscode.com/blog/2010/10/20/chef-reaches-200-contributors/&quot;&gt;awesome Chef community&lt;/a&gt; made this possible. If you haven&amp;#8217;t used the &amp;#8220;cookbook site&amp;#8221; subcommands in knife yet, take a moment to try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain;&quot;&gt;
$ knife cookbook site --help

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be traveling in the northeastern US from 10/28 through 11/13. Current plans put me in DC from 10/28 &amp;#8211; 11/1. Then I&amp;#8217;ll be in Boston on Tuesday 11/2 for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesimplelogic.com/boston-devops-meetups/&quot;&gt;Boston Devops Meetup&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday 11/3, I will be in NYC for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/nycdevops/calendar/14955020/&quot;&gt;NYC Devops Meetup at drop.io&lt;/a&gt;. Following that, I will be stationed back in my hometown in Maine until returning to Seattle on 11/13. If you&amp;#8217;d like to catch up with me about operations with Chef while I am in the region, or have me stop by somewhere and give a presentation, send me an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:btm@loftninjas.org&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; and we can make arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t catch that the laser etch featured in the last post was done on a pumpkin, take a minute to consider the possibilities… you’re sitting around a warm campfire, eating s’mores, when suddenly a bear pops out of the forest and says to you,… -Oh, wait- that’s the wrong story.  In any case, we haven’t thought of all the possibilities, but we do know that you could make some pretty sweet pumpkin* Halloween art with the laser.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you’re still looking for ideas for that killer costume- check out our workshops and get yourself some electronics, Arduino, and laser love:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced I/O for the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, October 10   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt;The importance of the Arduino is mostly in how you can interface it with the rest of the analog world. We’ll talk about using analog inputs to sense light and sound. We’ll also go over using PWM to control the brightness of LEDs. Lastly, we’ll cover how to use servo motors.  This class comes with several sensors and other components. &lt;br /&gt;You’ll need your laptop, a breadboard, and Arduino with USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inkscape for Laser Cutting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, October 14  7-9:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $50 for non-members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an introduction to Inkscape, focusing on the tools needed for laser cutting. It is appropriate for those who have never used or have limited experience with Inkscape.  The last half hour of the class is supervised design time where you can create your own 3”x5” design and have it cut it out in 3mm thick birch using the laser cutter. &lt;br /&gt;This workshop requires a laptop with the latest version of Inkscape installed and a mouse with a scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Electronics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, October 17   2-4:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt;This workshop covers everything you need to know to get started in electronics. We’ll start from the basics of electricity and work our way up to using integrated circuits. Fading, blinking, and dimming LEDs help demonstrate key electronics concepts. You’ll leave this workshop with a kit of everything you need to build the circuits we cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inkscape for Laser Cutting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, October 23  2-4:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $50 for non-members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro to the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, October 28  7-9pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $50 for non-members, plus a $10 materials fee&lt;br /&gt;This workshop will cover the basics of the Arduino. We’ll go over what it is, what it can do, and why you’d want to use it. We’ll also go over a couple of basic programs. This course is great for people who’ve never programmed before and have no microcontroller experience.  If you like to learn things sequentially and individually, you may want to consider attending the Intro to Electronics workshop first.   &lt;br /&gt;With Intro to Arduino, we’ll give you a breadboard and some simple components.  The $10 fee gets you an arduino and USB cable. This workshop requires a laptop (if you aren’t paying the materials fee for an arduino, you will need to bring an Arduino Duemilanove and USB cable as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Pumpkin must be smaller than approximately 8” in diameter.  Pumpkin-like, edible (or non-edible) gourds and squash may or may not produce similar results.  For cutting through the pumpkin, it must be scooped out; etching and vector cuts can be done in either state.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: Installing powershell on Window Server 2008 with Chef</title>
	<guid>http://blog.loftninjas.org/?p=502</guid>
	<link>http://blog.loftninjas.org/2010/09/30/installing-powershell-on-window-server-2008-with-chef/</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple example of automation on Windows using Chef. Powershell is our gateway to nearly all parts of modern Windows servers so it is one of the first packages we want to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was tested on EC2 (ami-c3e40daa) running Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Datacenter edition. You will need to start with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation+on+Windows&quot;&gt;Chef installation directions for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, with either your own &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation&quot;&gt;Chef server&lt;/a&gt; built out or an &lt;a href=&quot;https://cookbooks.opscode.com/users/new&quot;&gt;Opscode Platform&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those familiar with Chef will notice this looks exactly like a recipe for a Linux system, provided that we were installing software without the benefit of a package manager. This recipe simply downloads the installer and then executes it with a switch to perform the installation silently. Also note that I pass the &amp;#8220;/norestart&amp;#8221; switch as well. MSU is a standalone microsoft update installer, rather than a plain executable. This installation will trigger hooks normally associated with updates, which also means that it triggers a restart. I hadn&amp;#8217;t thought about this the first time I ran this recipe and thought for a moment that my system had crashed. In actuality it performed flawlessly and the system restarted with powershell installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote file resource (line nineteen) only downloads the installer if it isn&amp;#8217;t present or has changed. If Microsoft changes the placement of this package on their website, you would have to update this resource. Alternately, you could place these important files on an internal web server or file server, or place them directly in the cookbook and transfer them to the server using the cookbook file resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The execute resource (line twenty-three) only runs the installer if the remote file resource has chosen to download this file. The &amp;#8220;:nothing&amp;#8221; action tells the resource to not run, specifically so that it wouldn&amp;#8217;t run everything. However the subscribes attribute hooks into the prior remote file resource so that it will run if that resource performs an action. You can find more information regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home&quot;&gt;Chef wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows servers no longer need to remain in the land of &amp;#8220;as-built&amp;#8221; documentation, where a wiki page or word doc specified the individual steps someone ran to build out this particular system, where additional builds took days as we found the time to run all of the software installers by hand. Chef recipes can both build out your systems and simultaneously document the process for you naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been to the shop in the past week or so, you may have noticed our “Sad Laser is Sad” sign.  Well, while the laser is patiently waiting for a new tube so it can be 100% happy again, we have hooked the old one back up and are capable of running most jobs with a little setting-tweaking.  6mm acrylic is out until we get in the new tube, but other materials should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on by and get your project going!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: Silent Ruby install on Windows</title>
	<guid>http://blog.loftninjas.org/?p=499</guid>
	<link>http://blog.loftninjas.org/2010/09/28/silent-ruby-install-on-windows/</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dug up unattended ruby install directions while working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation+on+Windows&quot;&gt;Chef installation directions for windows&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the secrets can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/rubyinstaller&quot;&gt;RubyInstaller discussion group&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/rubyinstaller/browse_thread/thread/4b2cb71cf5567080/ec94510f5e2c2a0d&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/rubyinstaller/browse_thread/thread/8b936114861f6e30/3231e9ec2fbb2c36&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/&quot;&gt;RubyInstaller&lt;/a&gt; for windows, then run: &lt;code&gt;rubyinstaller-1.8.7-p302.exe /tasks=&quot;assocfiles,modpath&quot; /silent&lt;/code&gt;. The tasks option checks (enables) the options to associated .rb files with ruby and adding the ruby binary directory to the path. You probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t want these if you were installing multiple versions of ruby.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;panoptos by Matt Westervelt, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattw/4998094158/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4105/4998094158_c42c31ed64.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; alt=&quot;panoptos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October is coming, and with that, our one year anniversary (party details coming soon).   As many of you know, we are expanding, and working towards our mission of having a space where &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; can make anything, big or small.   Lately, in addition to all of this, we’ve been giving some attention to a few of our local artists and helping them make some awesome things.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://suttonberesculler.com/current.html&quot;&gt;SuttonBeresCuller&lt;/a&gt; have been working in open studio at the Henry Art Museum and building Panoptos, an art installation (giant robot) that will be unveiled and publicly interactive on October 1st for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://henryart.org/calendar/announcement?id=17&quot;&gt;Henry’s Fall Open House&lt;/a&gt;. We have been quietly helping, and even got a chance to get out of the basement (and into the Henry’s) for some robot troubleshooting, it’s only a few frames in their super cool build video, but it was a blast to be a part of their awesome project.   We have heard the Henry Open Houses are a really good time, so we won’t be offended if you spend your Friday night playing with their robots instead of ours.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/13919078&quot;&gt;Henry Art Gallery Installation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user1937077&quot;&gt;SuttonBeresCuller&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;313&quot; width=&quot;287&quot; src=&quot;http://meghantrainor.com/img/trainor2010.jpg&quot; /&gt;Another super exciting development is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://meghantrainor.com/&quot;&gt;Meghan Trainor&lt;/a&gt;, a DXArts doctoral student, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dxarts.washington.edu/courses/198c/&quot;&gt;instructor&lt;/a&gt; and super busy &lt;a href=&quot;http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/09/01/currently-hanging-charles-parrish-and-meghan-trainor&quot;&gt;visual artist&lt;/a&gt;, has accepted our offer to be the first official &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist_in_residence&quot;&gt;artist-in-residence&lt;/a&gt; at Metrix Create:Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   What this means is that in addition to our normal chaos, there will be bona-fide art insanity as Meghan goes through our toolboxes, gets deep with the machines and installs a unique creation in our space that could only have been made in our space.  &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been meaning to take our Arudino workshop series and have been putting it off to the future, keep in mind that we will be adding a small materials fee to the Intro to Arduino class after the September 30th class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have already taken the Intro to Arduino class (or are already familiar with using the Arduino platform), you may find our Arduino series classes to be just what you’re looking for to take your design to the next level.  We will be re-offering our &lt;strong&gt;Programming for Arduino&lt;/strong&gt; class twice this week (due to a schedule conflict with the original 8/29 date).  So, if you missed signing up for it that time around, be sure to sign up for either &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this Thursday, September 9 from 7-9pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;this Saturday, September 11 from 2-4pm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Follow it up by taking our &lt;strong&gt;Arduino I/O&lt;/strong&gt; (this Sunday, September 12 from 2-4pm) and &lt;strong&gt;Arduino Robots&lt;/strong&gt; (next Sunday, September 19 from 2-4pm) classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t fit the Arduino classes into your schedule this time around, make sure to sign up the next time around. We can hardly wait to see the next cool Arduino project you will put together!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Workshops, workshops, workshops!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at what we have  this month and sign up early to reserve your spot.  If you haven’t made  it down to the shop yet, please come by to see us and sign up.  If  you’re already a familiar face and know your way to our door, you are  also welcome to call to secure your spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you down here soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced I/O for the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday, September  12   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; The importance of the  Arduino is mostly in how you can interface it  with the rest of the  analog world.

We’ll spend the class  integrating sensors, motors, and various  programming techniques into a  line following robot car. &lt;br /&gt; We’ll give  you most of the supplies, but  you’ll also need everything from the other  three workshops (which you  can buy separately if you only want to take  this class).  Please bring your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Electronics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tuesday, September 21    7-9:30pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This workshop covers  everything you need to  know to get started in   electronics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro to the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thursday, September 30  7-9pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This workshop will cover the basics of  the Arduino. We’ll go over what  it is, what it can do, and why you’d  want to use it. We’ll also go  over a couple of basic programs. This  course is great for people who’ve  never programmed before and have no  microcontroller experience. We’ll  give you an Arduino, a breadboard, and  some simple components. &lt;br /&gt;This workshop requires a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;… and, so far, we have scheduled for October…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Casey Halverson: Nike+ Venue Check-In Hardware, a How-To Guide</title>
	<guid>http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/?p=66</guid>
	<link>http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/?p=66</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://www.seattlewireless.net/~casey/casey.png" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least two ways to build the Nike+ Check-In Hardware that talks to stumble.to.  One is easy, one is a bit difficult.  I will first focus on the easy way, and then if you are daring enough with your soldering skills, I will send you off in the right direction for a more difficult way that does not require the very handy SparkFun hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nike+ Sensor Sport Kit (this is the one with the white receiver and a Nike+ shoe sensor)
&lt;li&gt;More Nike+ Sensors for your friends (they sell these slightly cheaper without the white receiver)
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8245&quot;&gt;SparkFun Nike+iPod Serial Adapter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini USB cable
&lt;li&gt;Maybe a nice non-metal box to put it in
&lt;li&gt;Maybe some Nike+ sensor clips for non-Nike shoes
&lt;li&gt;Any desktop, laptop, or embedded computer system (Unix or Mac OSX is best, Windows may need some extra work)
&lt;li&gt;A stumble.to account and API key
&lt;li&gt;The stumble.to nike agent&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into trouble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact our support department, er, i mean, Casey, by emailing casey_nike_support @ mobilesquared.com.   Tell me as much as you can about your situation and I will try to steer you in the right direction.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:  Connecting up the hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting the hardware is very simple, thanks to the prefabricated Nike+iPod SparkFun board.  Simply connect the white receiver to the iPod connector.  Plug the USB into the SparkFun board and the computer.  A red LED will light up, and a new serial port will be created on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:  Installing the software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is usually on most unixes and standard with Mac OSX.  If not, it should not be too hard to find it with popular packaging systems.  One thing that probably isn&amp;#8217;t automatically installed is PySerial, but this is easy to.  Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;PySerial&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s website and follow the installation instructions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:  Identifying your serial port&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nike+iPod is a standard FTDI serial device, and nearly every operating system will automatically find the drivers on connection.  On most unix-based operating systems, check the /dev directory for a new serial port.    On my Snow Leopard Mac, this can be as easy as typing &amp;#8216;ls /dev/*usbserial*&amp;#8217; in the terminal.  In my particular case, the Nike+iPod shows up as &amp;#8220;/dev/tty.usbserial-A600e18v&amp;#8221;.   If you still have a hard time seeing it, try unplugging it and plugging it back in and seeing if a new file pops up in /dev that looks like a serial port.  Write down whatever the serial port is so you can modify the python script with the correct serial port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:  Get yourself a stumble.to account and API key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stumble.to supports a variety of authentication systems (I simply just use google to log in).  Now that you have an account, you can add your API key.  Go to &amp;#8220;venues&amp;#8221; and create a new test venue (or link it to an existing foursquare venue).  After you create your venue, you will see an API key and API secret.  Write these down because you will need them for the python script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:  Download the stumble.to Nike agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the python script here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumble.to/downloads/stumbleto-shoe-agent.py&quot;&gt;http://www.stumble.to/downloads/stumbleto-shoe-agent.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:  Edit the script with your API settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the python script you downloaded in your favorite editor, and edit the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Adjust these values as appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
API_KEY    = 'YOUR_API_KEY'&lt;br /&gt;
API_SECRET = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'&lt;br /&gt;
DEVICE     = '/dev/tty.usbserial-A600e18v'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Populate the values you obtained for the API key, secret, and serial port in the above locations.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7:  Run the script and see if it works!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the script (ie:  python stumbleto-shoe-agent.py) and watch the console.  The script will initialize the Nike+ hardware and start listening on the air.  Pick up your Nike+ sensor and jiggle it like you are going to role some dice.  Rather shortly, it should see the Nike+ sensor and print out a hex serial number like: 8d-10-92-2f.   This is the Nike+ sensor UID number that you will need to put into your stumble.to account.  If you have more sensors, repeat the same process and be sure to keep track which is which. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and quit the script for now after you are done with this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8:  Visit the stumble.to site and enter your Nike+ UID and Foursquare account information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Nike+ sensor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the stumble.to site, log in, and click &amp;#8220;Add Device&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the name, you can put anything, but I suggest looking on the back for the serial number of the Nike+ sensor and using this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select Nike+ sensor for the type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Enter the UID we discovered above where it say UID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the foursquare connection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stumble.to uses oauth for authenticating users on third party services.  This means we do not store your login or password information on our server.  This step is no more painful than authorizing a third party to use your twitter, facebook, etc. log in information and its used for us to check you into venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on &amp;#8220;Add Service&amp;#8221;, and select foursquare (and possibly twitter and fire eagle if you want to announce your stumble.to check ins to these services as well)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 9:  Run the script to Nike+ enable the venue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the stumbleto-shoe-agent.py python script and either walk around your sensor or jiggle it a little.  It will see your device.  Congratulations!  You just made your first Nike+ check in!  You can also keep it in a backpack, purse, pocket, etc. so you don&amp;#8217;t need to fuss with it again.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to let us know about your newly enabled venue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And for some value add..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stumble.to can also detect any WiFi device in range for auto-checkin (Laptop, iPhone, android, etc).  Be sure to check out some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumble.to/about/api&quot;&gt;example scripts you can run on some WiFi routers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those who want to try to the hard way&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually not too hard if you have a steady hand.  You will need a level shifter (FTDI is suggested, as it does have a 3.3V output that can drive the iPod receiver circuitry) and some wire.   All you need to do is solder up a few grounds, TX, RX, and 3.3V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the SparkFun &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/DevTools/iPod/Nike_iPod_Serial_Schematic.pdf&quot;&gt;schematic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/systems/privacy.html&quot;&gt;Here is a link to a UW security project&lt;/a&gt; that involved soldering directly to the receiver pins.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7zd33X1sf1qa5a6qo1_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://foursquare.com/&quot;&gt;foursquare &lt;/a&gt;user, you may have noticed that the Mayor of Metrix Create:Space gets half-off 3D Printing, and we occasionally give things away for people with &lt;a href=&quot;http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/970589352/the-winner-of-our-leet-foursqare-check-in&quot;&gt;fun numbers&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a few of our friends, it’s never been easier to get that Mayorship.   &lt;a href=&quot;http://stumble.to/&quot;&gt;Stumble.to&lt;/a&gt; is a service provided by Eric and Ian that automatically checks you in when you walk in and have your WiFi device with you (laptop, phone, itouch, anything with a MAC address really).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;353&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/stumbleto.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Casey has just &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/?p=37&quot;&gt;announced the addition of Nike+ support&lt;/a&gt;.   Now all you need is the shoes that cover your feet (provided they’re electronically chatty) or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RR6TZY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=seattlewirele-20&quot;&gt;Nike+ sport sensor&lt;/a&gt; in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re the first venue to deploy this, so let us know what you think!   &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Casey Halverson: Introducing Nike+ Foursquare Check-in and Stumble.to</title>
	<guid>http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/?p=37</guid>
	<link>http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/?p=37</link>
	<description>&lt;img src="http://www.seattlewireless.net/~casey/casey.png" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainstorm9.com.br/social-media/check-in-automatico-no-foursquare-atraves-do-seu-tenis-com-nike/&quot;&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://popupcity.net/2010/08/auto-check-ins-with-nike-and-foursquare/&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobilebehavior.com/2010/07/21/wearable-computing-check-in-here-on-foursquare-via-nike/&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danielprager.com/wearable-computing-nike-plus-foursquare-via-mobile-behavior/&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/?p=25&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; I made earlier this year, so after working a few late nights with &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebutler.com/&quot;&gt;Eric Butler&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://metrixcreatespace.com/&quot;&gt;Metrix Create:Space&lt;/a&gt;, we now have a public friendly version of the Nike+ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foursquare.com&quot;&gt;foursquare&lt;/a&gt; check in system!   Not only do I have a much nicer collection of hardware and software, but anyone can now add their Nike+ shoes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumble.to&quot;&gt;http://stumble.to/&lt;/a&gt; so they can check in too!   Eric has put a lot of work into polishing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumble.to&quot;&gt;stumble.to&lt;/a&gt; service to allow functionality for the masses, which not only supports my Nike+ auto check-ins, but WiFi automatic check-ins!   Not only can your shoes check in to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foursquare.com&quot;&gt;foursquare&lt;/a&gt;, but so can your laptop, PDA or smart phone when it enters in range of a stumble.to enabled WiFi access point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/nikehw.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one flagship venue is enabled with this system (&lt;a href=&quot;http://metrixcreatespace.com/&quot;&gt;Metrix Create:Space&lt;/a&gt;), located in Seattle, Washington, but I hope to add more venues soon with this capability.   If you own a venue interested in supporting automatic Nike+ and WiFi check-ins, be sure to contact me privately for more details. (casey_nikefoursquare @ mobilesquared.com) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumble.to&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/stumbleto.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope to release some code and hardware instructions shortly.   Eric Butler will also be publishing some information on how to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumble.to&quot;&gt;stumble.to&lt;/a&gt; API&amp;#8217;s to interface all sorts of interesting presence-detecting technology that people will eventually dream up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to write a more technical post soon, but this should be more than enough to get people going. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=135&quot;&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/systems/privacy.html&quot;&gt;done quite a bit&lt;/a&gt; with Nike+ hardware, so these are some good reads if you want to learn more before then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Eric, filer, and chronomex for helping to make this all come together, as well as Metrix Create:Space for hosting the first deployment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 9/2/2010&lt;/b&gt;:  As promised, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stumble.to/downloads/stumbleto-shoe-agent.py&quot;&gt;here is a link to the nike shoe stumble.to software&lt;/a&gt; so you can get started running your own!  All you need to do is obtain an API key (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stumble.to&quot;&gt;sign up for stumble.to&lt;/a&gt;), install &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlewireless.net/www.python.org&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;PySerial&lt;/a&gt;, and buy yourself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlewireless.net/~casey/ http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8245&quot;&gt;SparkFun iPod to USB adapter&lt;/a&gt;.  Make sure to remember to edit the script and change your API key, as well as specify the serial port that your USB adapter appears as.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a brief respite over the next few weeks, I&amp;#8217;ll be joining Opscode in September. Not only am I excited about working with such a &lt;a href=&quot;http://opscode.com/team&quot;&gt;great group of people&lt;/a&gt;, but also for the incredible opportunity of getting to work on problems whose solutions are already beginning to permanently change how we build systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, we should be solving life&amp;#8217;s more difficult problems, not passing our days as a cog in a machine of repetitious activity. When skilled and respected humans become mere automatons of deployment tasks; we&amp;#8217;ve slipped into a dismal place. There is boundless room out there for innovation, but we need a dependable platform on which to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m joining Opscode to help craft this reality. I want to help you find meaning in these tools; how they will make your life easier. Don&amp;#8217;t confuse this end as simply being able to work faster, it&amp;#8217;s about working better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: (Still) Upcoming Workshops for August and September</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/949602980</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/949602980</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This is just a reminder even though we’re halfway through this sunniest of Seattle months, we still have plenty of workshops left to take in August in addition to the workshops that have already been scheduled for September. You can see what we’ve got lined up below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inkscape for Laser Cutting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, August 21  2-4:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;img alt=&quot;bunny&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4889630596_ba91c1c14d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an  introduction to Inkscape, focusing on the tools needed for laser  cutting. It is appropriate for those who have never used or have limited  experience with Inkscape.  The last half hour of the class is  supervised design time where you can create your own 3”x5” design and  have it cut it out in 3mm thick birch using the laser cutter. &lt;br /&gt;This  workshop requires a laptop with the latest version of Inkscape installed  and a mouse with a scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro to the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Saturday, August 28   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This workshop will cover the basics of  the Arduino. We’ll go over what it is, what it can do, and why you’d  want to use it. We’ll also go over a couple of basic programs. This  course is great for people who’ve never programmed before and have no  microcontroller experience. We’ll give you an Arduino, a breadboard, and  some simple components. &lt;br /&gt;This workshop requires a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arduino Programming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday, August 29   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; Now that you’ve gotten some familiarity  with the Arduino, it’s time to learn how to program the thing. We’ll  cover programming basics like functions, loops, and conditionals. We’ll  also talk about how to use classes, though we won’t be writing any.&lt;br /&gt;This  class requires an arduino and breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Electronics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tuesday, August 31    7-9:30pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This workshop covers  everything you need to  know to get started in  electronics. We’ll start  from the basics of  electricity and work our  way up to using  integrated circuits. Fading,  blinking, and dimming LEDs  help  demonstrate key electronics concepts.  You’ll leave this workshop  with a  kit of everything you need to build  the circuits we cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…And in September…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced I/O for the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday, September  12   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; The importance of the  Arduino is mostly in how you can interface it with the rest of the  analog world. We’ll talk about using analog inputs to sense light and  sound. We’ll also go over using PWM to control the brightness of LEDs.  Lastly, we’ll cover how to use servo motors.  This class comes with  several sensors and other components. &lt;br /&gt;You’ll need a breadboard and  Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arduino Robots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday, September 19   2-5pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This last Arduino workshop will wrap  everything from the other workshops together into an interesting  project. We’ll spend the class integrating sensors, motors, and various  programming techniques into a line following robot car. &lt;br /&gt;We’ll give  you most of the supplies, but you’ll also need everything from the other  three workshops (which you can buy separately if you only want to take  this class).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These were cut on the laser from several different sheets of veneer, glued together and clamped while it dried, and then finished with a two-part resin. They are destined to be made into a pair of matching barrettes.  And yes, we usually have birch veneer around for lasercutting if you decide you want to make something like this yourself :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They cut this pretty little table, some tiny keys, and this cute &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:286&quot;&gt;little standing elephant&lt;/a&gt;, all from files off of Thingiverse. There are tons of neat plans and files like this on the site made for the MakerBot or the lasercutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thingiverse is more than just a place to find fun lasercutting projects; it’s made to promote sharing. If you have a cool design on file, you can upload it to Thingiverse and share it with the world. We here at Metrix like sharing &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; that we’ll give you a &lt;strong&gt;20% discount for anything made on the MakerBots or the lasercutter from a Thingiverse download&lt;/strong&gt;. Share and save!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Want to bundle a web page into a single file, without a _files directory, or using the not-supported-everywhere .mht (IE, Opera) or .webarchive (Safari) formats? Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/afiler/pagecan&quot;&gt;pagecan&lt;/a&gt;! I developed pagecan so I can return converted documents on &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.mar.cx/&quot;&gt;doc.mar.cx&lt;/a&gt; as a single file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pagecan will take an URL of an HTML document, grab all resources referenced by &amp;#8220;src&amp;#8221;, and bundle the page and encoded resources into a single file, through the use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme&quot;&gt;data URI scheme&lt;/a&gt;. pagecan is written in Ruby and uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nokogiri.org/&quot;&gt;Nokogiri parser&lt;/a&gt; (you can install the gem with &lt;span&gt;gem install nokogiri&lt;/span&gt;, or the Debian package with &lt;span&gt;sudo apt-get install libnokogiri-ruby&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage: &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/afiler/pagecan&quot;&gt;pagecan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;url&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt; | -]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &amp;#8216;-&amp;#8217; or no file is given, output is sent to stdout. pagecan has been tested only with HTTP URLs, but as it uses Ruby open-uri, other URIs and local files may work.&lt;/p&gt;

	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/882218698</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/882218698</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have our standard workshop offerings in August and we will be bringing you a few more exotic ones in September.  Here is the lineup for August and a taste of what will be available in September.  If you would like to sign up for one, please come by the shop.  If you have already been by, you are welcome to sign up over the phone as well.  If you have any questions, we’d love to hear from you!See you here soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inkscape for Laser Cutting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, August 12  7-9:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt;This workshop is an introduction to Inkscape, focusing on the tools needed for laser cutting. It is appropriate for those who have never used or have limited experience with Inkscape.  The last half hour of the class is supervised design time where you can create your own 3”x5” design and have it cut it out in 3mm thick Birch using the laser cutter. &lt;br /&gt;This workshop requires a laptop with the latest version of Inkscape installed and a mouse with a scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inkscape for Laser Cutting&lt;/strong&gt; will also be held on:&lt;br /&gt; Saturday, August 21   2-4:30pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intro to the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Saturday, August 28   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This workshop will cover the basics of the Arduino. We’ll go over what it is, what it can do, and why you’d want to use it. We’ll also go over a couple of basic programs. This course is great for people who’ve never programmed before and have no microcontroller experience. We’ll give you an Arduino, a breadboard, and some simple components. &lt;br /&gt;This workshop requires a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arduino Programming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday, August 29   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; Now that you’ve gotten some familiarity with the Arduino, it’s time to learn how to program the thing. We’ll cover programming basics like functions, loops, and conditionals. We’ll also talk about how to use classes, though we won’t be writing any.&lt;br /&gt;This class requires an arduino and breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Electronics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tuesday, August 31   7-9:30pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This workshop covers everything you need to  know to get started in  electronics. We’ll start from the basics of  electricity and work our  way up to using integrated circuits. Fading,  blinking, and dimming LEDs  help demonstrate key electronics concepts.  You’ll leave this workshop  with a kit of everything you need to build  the circuits we cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…And in September…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced I/O for the Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday, September 12   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; The importance of the Arduino is mostly in how you can interface it with the rest of the analog world. We’ll talk about using analog inputs to sense light and sound. We’ll also go over using PWM to control the brightness of LEDs. Lastly, we’ll cover how to use servo motors.  This class comes with several sensors and other components. &lt;br /&gt;You’ll need a breadboard and Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arduino Robots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday, September 19   2-5pm&lt;br /&gt; Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt; This last Arduino workshop will wrap everything from the other workshops together into an interesting project. We’ll spend the class integrating sensors, motors, and various programming techniques into a line following robot car. &lt;br /&gt;We’ll give you most of the supplies, but you’ll also need everything from the other three workshops (which you can buy separately if you only want to take this class).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Metrix Create:Space: Dave Cole's Amazing Wooden DC Motor</title>
	<guid>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/863132644</guid>
	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/863132644</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For those who haven’t been following our blog religiously, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/shop/DavidScottCole&quot;&gt;Dave Cole&lt;/a&gt; is one of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbdh.com/&quot;&gt;PBDH&lt;/a&gt; regulars and a bit of a lasercutter addict. His newest project is a fully functional DC motor made entirely from Metrix Create: Space lasercut wood and a handful of parts from the hardware store. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Dave Cole's Homebrew DC Motor&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4820028539_195f8b858a.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave says he plans on making the kits available at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/shop/DavidScottCole&quot;&gt;Etsy store&lt;/a&gt; once he gets the design all shiny and vintage science-y looking for mass-production. I wonder if we can find a way to get some in our vending machine…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Bryan McLellan: Dependant Paradigms</title>

	<description>&lt;img src="http://planet.seattlewireless.net/heads/btm.jpg" align="right" alt=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Systems Administrator is likely the closet technological trade to skilled manual labor. They troubleshoot complex systems that others take for granted, until they fail, with a deceptive ease. Explaining to another how they had a hunch to look at a certain part of the system is either a retrospective tale of why it made sense, or a sarcastic nod to magic. This tale attempts to work out how one could have deduced the solution, but even if someone assembled a collection of symptoms and solutions into a step-by-step guide, they would not be able to replace the role of a Systems Administrator. Like an automotive mechanic can detect a blown head gasket from the smell of the oil, a Systems Administrator can sense infrastructure issues from how systems are behaving. And like a fondness for a make of automobile, we grow attached to Linux distributions that have treated us well and editors whose dark secrets we can manipulate skillfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had a student who didn&amp;#8217;t understand why we couldn&amp;#8217;t repair board-level hardware issues ourselves as easily as replacing a stick of memory, as their uncle was capable of repairing any engine problems by opening up the hood and quite literally &amp;#8220;jiggling some wires.&amp;#8221; A mystic knowledge exists in both worlds that is challenging to articulate to the layman. It can be difficult enough to explain a single component, but when a part of a system falls over and causes cascading failures in other parts of a system, outsiders are tempted to believe that they&amp;#8217;ve just learned a truth about the solution. That is, that when certain symptoms occur, it is always caused by the failure of a particular part and that this part should be restarted to &amp;#8217;solve&amp;#8217; the problem. Yet, the experienced know that this only resolves the symptoms and the still problem lurks, now with fewer hints as to its origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future is already here &amp;#8211; it is just unevenly distributed. &amp;#8212; William Gibson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with paradigm shifts is that they aren&amp;#8217;t necessarily direct improvements on existing technology with a clear lineage. Critics ask why the new ways are better than that which they replace, and we struggle to draw the path that led us to this new place of understanding. The struggle is because instead of making a choice at a clear intersection of a path, we stepped through the bushes to another path not as obviously traveled. This alternate path may lead us to the same end, but its course has an entirely different shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further exacerbate the problem, new innovations stand on the shoulders of giants. Some people have been convinced of the merits of leveraging cloud computing on a strictly financial basis, and have missed the tenants of Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting (UHL), where running servers and building networks may not be ones core business and ultimately a distraction. Some have yet to grasp the concept of treating systems, even built on internal hardware, as disposable, still accustomed to legacy processes of maintaining a system for the lifetime of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to realize that these new technologies are not minor improvements to business as usual. Like the birth of globalization changing business around the world, nursed by the multi-modal shipping container&amp;#8217;s head fake as just another way of moving cargo, todays innovations will surely reshape the face of operations permanently, in substantial and non-incremental ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://metrixcreatespace.com/post/786388590</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;And now the post you’ve all been waiting for… our July workshops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month we have four exciting opportunities for you to get your feet wet creating 2D designs you could then cut out on the laser etcher, using electronics, and learning how to use the Arduino prototyping board—  all getting you well on your way to making something really awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inkscape for Laser Cutting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, July 17   2-4pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost:  $50 for non-members&lt;br /&gt;This workshop is an introduction to Inkscape,  focusing on the tools needed for laser cutting.

The plan is to provide free but limited Internet access to neighbors and sell service to those who need a &amp;#8220;fatter pipe&amp;#8221; as the kids say.  We&amp;#8217;ve been running a repeater for over a year now.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t provide access to the Internet, but allows anyone who can see the repeater to exchange IP packets.
