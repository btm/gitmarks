<p class=section>Technology</p>
I am a Systems Administrator.
This means I can discern what part of an infrastructure is doing it wrong while the building is on fire without spilling my drink.
I also have strong opinions about community and if asked to will wax on about paradigm shifts like cloud computing and configuration management.
As open source software is the Right[tm] way and Good, I make a point to contribute and spend a lot of time thinking about how to leverage the core values
of the movement in other projects.
I write about this in the usual fashion in a <a href="http://www.loftninjas.org/blog">blog</a>.
I have a <a href="http://attic.loftninjas.org/btm/BryanMcLellan-Resume.pdf">resume</a>, if you're interested in that sort of thing.
However, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanmclellan">linkedin</a>, is surely more up to date.

<p class=section>Logisitics, Dirt + Advocacy</p>
I grew up in a small town in the woods and keep relatively close to the earth as a matter of principle. 
This has also earned me a self-reliant streak. Consequently, I am a useful person to have around.
Having realized this, I volunteer my time to a slew of various organizations.
I believe in making a difference through action and leadership and can sometimes be found in unexpected places.

<p>I spend time advocating the use of bicycles as a primary mode of transportation in urban environments.
I occasionally contribute writing to <a href="http://seattlelikesbikes.org/">Seattle Likes Bikes</a>
and sometimes help organize local bicycle related events.
I host the <a href="http://www.seattlecriticalmass.org">Seattle Critical Mass</a> website, and do specific bicycle advocacy work in my neighborhood of <a href="http://bikegeorgetown.org">Georgetown</a> in Seattle. 
Additionally I have a side project called <a href="http://bikealive.org">Bike Alive</a> that hopes to reduce collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles.

<p>Currently, I am an organizer for <a href="http://www.alleycatacres.com">Alleycat Acres</a>, an urban farming collective,
and work toward increasing urban agriculture in Seattle by creating resources to engage people to support the local food movement,
and empower them to be more self-sustaining with the end goal of reducing food insecurity. 
As time marches on I've been getting more involved in local policy to set the stage for additional opportunities.

<p>I am also a logistics/mss volunteer for <a href="http://www.seattleredcross.org/">American Red Cross</a>. I spend every third week on call to help the
American Red Cross respond to a major disaster and in return receive regular training in a variety of disaster related positions. As a FCC licensed
Amateur Radio operator I am also a member of the local chapters emergency communication team.

<p class=section>Social Networking</p>
I believe we can combine information with technology to make our lives better in interesting and useful ways. Thus, the internet knows a lot about me.
Some parts of it are a bit old, while other parts may let you know what I'm up to right now. Consider this the index to a hall of mirrors.

<p class=section>Personal</p>
It is commonly accepted among people that aren't fools that you can build better systems in the open than behind closed doors. 
You have to be able to gracefully accept criticism and have patience for misunderstanding, but the ends justify the means.
If you have gotten this far and are still interested in learning more about me,
I keep my <a href="http://loftninjas.org/rants">personal journal</a> open to the public. 
<p>While I've decided that the cost of any consequences there are to my openness are worthwhile, I can't make that decision for other people in my life.
Accordingly, names are often reduced to a single character and as I know very many people this provides adequate ambiguity.
Of course such writing is usually spurred by emotion and ends up lacking context, so I would recommend affording it a lot of humour.
